# Firefly Rule Engine - Governance Guidelines

**Team standards for rule complexity and feature usage**

*Helping organizations choose appropriate rule engine features for their context*

---

## Purpose of This Guide

This guide helps teams establish standards for:
- 🎯 **Feature Selection**: Which DSL features are appropriate for your team's skill level
- 📏 **Complexity Management**: When to use simple vs. advanced patterns
- 👥 **Team Coordination**: Ensuring consistent rule development practices
- 🔄 **Maintenance Strategy**: Balancing functionality with long-term maintainability

---

## Team Maturity Assessment

Before choosing rule complexity, assess your team's readiness:

### 🟢 Beginner Team Profile
**Characteristics:**
- New to rule engines or business rules
- Prefers simple, readable solutions
- Values quick implementation over advanced features
- Limited time for complex rule maintenance

**Recommended Approach:**
- Start with [Quick Start Guide](quick-start-guide.md)
- Use only Basic patterns from [Common Patterns Guide](common-patterns-guide.md)
- Avoid external API integrations initially
- Focus on simple `when/then/else` syntax

### 🟡 Intermediate Team Profile
**Characteristics:**
- Some experience with rule engines
- Comfortable with moderate complexity
- Has dedicated time for rule maintenance
- Needs multi-factor decision making

**Recommended Approach:**
- Use Basic and Intermediate patterns
- Introduce sequential processing gradually
- Start with simple API integrations
- Mix simple and complex syntax as needed

### 🔴 Advanced Team Profile
**Characteristics:**
- Experienced with rule engines and complex systems
- Has dedicated rule engine specialists
- Requires sophisticated business logic
- Comfortable with external system integration

**Recommended Approach:**
- Use all pattern complexity levels
- Implement comprehensive error handling
- Leverage full DSL feature set
- Design for high performance and resilience

## Feature Usage Guidelines

### Core Features (Recommended for All Teams)

These features should be used by teams at any maturity level:

```yaml
# ✅ Always Appropriate
- Basic comparisons (>=, <=, ==, !=)
- Simple set operations
- Basic calculations
- Input/output definitions
- Simple when/then/else logic
```

**Example - Always Safe:**
```yaml
when:
  - creditScore >= 650
  - annualIncome > 40000
then:
  - set approved to true
  - calculate monthly_income as annualIncome / 12
```

### Intermediate Features (Use with Caution)

These features require some experience and ongoing maintenance:

```yaml
# 🟡 Use with Team Experience
- Multiple rules with dependencies
- Complex boolean expressions
- List operations (append, prepend, remove)
- Validation operators (is_email, is_phone)
- Conditional actions (if/then within actions)
```

**Example - Requires Experience:**
```yaml
rules:
  - name: "Stage 1"
    when: [creditScore >= 600]
    then: [set stage1_passed to true]
  
  - name: "Stage 2"
    when: [stage1_passed == true, income > 50000]
    then: [set final_approved to true]
```

### Advanced Features (Expert Teams Only)

These features should only be used by experienced teams:

```yaml
# 🔴 Expert Teams Only
- REST API integrations
- JSON path operations
- Circuit breaker patterns
- Complex condition blocks
- External function calls
```

**Example - Expert Level:**
```yaml
then:
  - calculate api_data as rest_get("https://api.example.com/data")
  - calculate user_name as json_get(api_data, "user.name")
  - if api_call_failed then circuit_breaker "API_UNAVAILABLE"
```

## Complexity Decision Matrix

Use this matrix to choose appropriate rule complexity:

| Business Logic Complexity | Team Experience | Recommended Pattern | Maintenance Effort |
|---------------------------|------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Simple** (Yes/No decisions) | Any | 🟢 Basic | Low |
| **Moderate** (Multi-factor) | Intermediate+ | 🟡 Intermediate | Medium |
| **Complex** (Multi-stage) | Advanced | 🔴 Advanced | High |
| **Integration** (External APIs) | Expert | 🔴 Advanced | Very High |

### Decision Questions

Ask these questions to guide your choice:

1. **"Can this be solved with simple if/then logic?"**
   - Yes → Use Basic patterns
   - No → Continue to question 2

2. **"Does this require multiple processing stages?"**
   - Yes → Consider Intermediate patterns
   - No → Stick with Basic patterns

3. **"Do we need external data or complex error handling?"**
   - Yes → Consider Advanced patterns (if team is ready)
   - No → Use Intermediate patterns

4. **"Is our team comfortable maintaining complex rules?"**
   - No → Step down one complexity level
   - Yes → Proceed with chosen complexity

## Organizational Standards

### Rule Naming Conventions

Establish consistent naming across your organization:

```yaml
# ✅ Good Naming
name: "Credit_Assessment_v2.1"
description: "Evaluates credit applications using updated criteria"

# ❌ Poor Naming
name: "rule1"
description: "checks stuff"
```

**Recommended Format:**
- **Name**: `BusinessArea_Purpose_Version` (e.g., `Lending_CreditCheck_v1.0`)
- **Description**: Clear business purpose and key criteria
- **Version**: Semantic versioning for tracking changes

### Documentation Requirements

Set documentation standards based on complexity:

| Complexity | Required Documentation |
|------------|----------------------|
| **🟢 Basic** | Name, description, business owner |
| **🟡 Intermediate** | + Input/output examples, test cases |
| **🔴 Advanced** | + Architecture diagrams, error handling docs |

### Code Review Standards

Establish review requirements:

```yaml
# Review Requirements by Complexity
Basic Rules:     1 reviewer (business analyst OK)
Intermediate:    1 technical reviewer + 1 business reviewer  
Advanced:        2 technical reviewers + 1 business reviewer
API Integration: Senior developer + architect review required
```

## Risk Management

### Common Pitfalls by Complexity Level

**🟢 Basic Pattern Risks:**
- Over-simplifying complex business logic
- Hard-coding values that should be configurable
- Missing edge cases in simple conditions

**🟡 Intermediate Pattern Risks:**
- Creating overly complex rule chains
- Poor error handling in multi-stage processing
- Difficult-to-debug sequential dependencies

**🔴 Advanced Pattern Risks:**
- External API failures breaking rule execution
- Performance issues with complex JSON operations
- Security vulnerabilities in API integrations

### Mitigation Strategies

**For All Complexity Levels:**
```yaml
# Always include error handling
else:
  - set error_occurred to true
  - set error_message to "Specific error description"
  - call log with ["Error in rule: " + error_message, "ERROR"]
```

**For Intermediate and Advanced:**
```yaml
# Add circuit breakers for external dependencies
circuit_breaker:
  enabled: true
  failure_threshold: 3
  timeout_duration: "10s"
```

## Migration Strategy

### Growing Team Capabilities

**Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-3)**
- Train team on Basic patterns
- Implement simple rules only
- Establish naming and documentation standards
- Build confidence with successful deployments

**Phase 2: Expansion (Months 4-8)**
- Introduce Intermediate patterns gradually
- Add multi-stage processing for complex scenarios
- Implement comprehensive testing practices
- Begin performance monitoring

**Phase 3: Advanced (Months 9+)**
- Evaluate need for Advanced patterns
- Implement API integrations if required
- Add sophisticated error handling
- Optimize for performance and resilience

### Legacy Rule Migration

When upgrading existing rules:

1. **Assess Current Complexity**: Categorize existing rules
2. **Plan Incremental Updates**: Don't rewrite everything at once
3. **Maintain Backward Compatibility**: Keep existing interfaces working
4. **Test Thoroughly**: Validate business logic hasn't changed
5. **Document Changes**: Track what was modified and why

## Success Metrics

Track these metrics to ensure governance is working:

### Development Metrics
- **Time to implement new rules** (should decrease over time)
- **Rule complexity distribution** (should match team capability)
- **Code review feedback volume** (should decrease as standards improve)

### Operational Metrics
- **Rule execution success rate** (should be >99%)
- **Performance degradation incidents** (should be minimal)
- **Business logic errors** (should decrease over time)

### Team Metrics
- **Developer confidence scores** (survey quarterly)
- **Rule maintenance effort** (hours per rule per month)
- **Knowledge sharing frequency** (team learning sessions)
