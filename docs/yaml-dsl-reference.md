## Introduction

The Firefly Rule Engine uses a powerful YAML-based Domain Specific Language (DSL) that is parsed using an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) approach. This guide documents the **actual implementation** based on comprehensive codebase analysis, ensuring accuracy and completeness.

> **üí° First Time Here?** This is a comprehensive reference. For a gentler introduction, start with the [Quick Start Guide](quick-start-guide.md) or browse [Common Patterns](common-patterns-guide.md) for real-world examples.

### Key Principles

- **AST-Based Parsing**: All syntax is parsed into strongly-typed AST nodes
- **Expression-Driven**: Actions and conditions support complex expressions
- **Type-Safe**: Variables have strict naming conventions for automatic type resolution
- **Extensible**: Support for REST API calls, JSON manipulation, and custom functions

### How to Use This Reference

- **üîç Find Specific Syntax**: Use the table of contents or search for keywords
- **üìã Copy Examples**: All code examples are tested and ready to use
- **üéØ Choose Complexity**: See [Governance Guidelines](governance-guidelines.md) for feature selection advice
- **üöÄ Get Started**: Try examples from [Quick Start Guide](quick-start-guide.md) first

then: [actions]                     # Actions when true
else: [actions]                     # Actions when false (optional)
```

**Complex Syntax:**
```yaml
conditions:                         # Structured condition blocks
  if: {condition_structure}
  then: {action_structure}
  else: {action_structure}
```

**Multiple Rules:**
```yaml
rules:                             # Array of sub-rules
  - name: "Sub-rule 1"
    when: [conditions]
    then: [actions]
```

  - set financial_data_complete to (
      monthlyRevenue is_positive AND
      monthlyExpenses is_positive AND
      annualIncome is_not_null
    )

  # Calculate boolean results with validation operators
  - calculate data_quality_score as (
      (customerName is_not_empty ? 25 : 0) +
      (email is_email ? 25 : 0) +
      (phone is_phone ? 25 : 0) +

## Variable Types and Naming

### 1. Input Variables (camelCase)
**Source**: API request `inputData` parameter  
**Naming**: `camelCase` (e.g., `creditScore`, `annualIncome`)  
**Purpose**: Dynamic runtime values

```yaml
inputs:
  - creditScore        # From API inputData
  - annualIncome       # From API inputData
  - employmentYears    # From API inputData
```

### 2. System Constants (UPPER_CASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES)
**Source**: Database constants table  
**Naming**: `UPPER_CASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES` (e.g., `MIN_CREDIT_SCORE`)  
**Purpose**: Configuration values, business parameters

```yaml
when:
  - creditScore at_least MIN_CREDIT_SCORE    # From database
  - loanAmount less_than MAX_LOAN_AMOUNT     # From database
```

### 3. Computed Variables (snake_case)
**Source**: Created during rule execution  
**Naming**: `snake_case` (e.g., `debt_ratio`, `final_score`)  
**Purpose**: Intermediate calculations, results

```yaml
then:
  - calculate debt_ratio as monthlyDebt / annualIncome    # snake_case
  - set approval_status to "APPROVED"                     # snake_case
```

---

## Core DSL Elements

### The `set` Operation

**Purpose**: Assign values to computed variables

**Syntax**: `set variable_name to value`

```yaml
then:
  - set approval_status to "APPROVED"
  - set risk_score to 75
  - set is_eligible to true
  - set processing_date to "2025-01-15"
```

### The `calculate` Operation

**Purpose**: Evaluate expressions and store results

**Syntax**: `calculate variable_name as expression`

**Key Insight**: `calculate` is NOT limited to mathematical operations. It can evaluate:
- Mathematical expressions
- Function calls (including REST API calls)
- JSON path operations
- Complex nested expressions

```yaml
then:
  # Mathematical calculations
  - calculate debt_ratio as monthlyDebt / (annualIncome / 12)
  - calculate compound_interest as principal * (1 + rate) ** years
  
  # Function calls
  - run max_value as max(value1, value2, value3)
  - calculate loan_payment as calculate_loan_payment(amount, rate, term)
  
  # REST API calls
  - run user_data as rest_get("https://api.example.com/users/123")
  - run api_response as rest_post("https://api.example.com/data", requestBody)
  
  # JSON operations
  - run user_name as json_get(user_data, "name")
  - run user_age as json_get(user_data, "age")
  - run has_email as json_exists(user_data, "email")
  
  # Complex expressions
  - calculate risk_score as ((creditScore * 0.6) + (annualIncome / 1000 * 0.3) + 50)
```

### The `when` Conditions

**Purpose**: Define conditions for rule execution

**Syntax**: List of condition strings

```yaml
when:
  - creditScore at_least 650
  - annualIncome greater_than 40000
  - employmentYears at_least 1
  - customerType in_list ["PREMIUM", "GOLD"]
```

### The `rules` Structure

**Purpose**: Define multiple sub-rules with sequential execution

```yaml
rules:
  - name: "Initial Assessment"
    when: creditScore at_least 600
    then:
      - set initial_eligible to true
    else:
      - set initial_eligible to false
      
  - name: "Final Decision"
    when: initial_eligible equals true
    then:
      - set final_decision to "APPROVED"
    else:
      - set final_decision to "DECLINED"
```

---

## Action Syntax

### Variable Assignment Actions

```yaml
# Simple assignment
- set variable_name to value

# Assignment with expressions
- set monthly_income to annualIncome / 12
- set full_name to firstName + " " + lastName

# Complex boolean expressions with validation operators (NEW FEATURE)
- set has_complete_financial_data to (
    monthlyRevenue is_positive AND
    monthlyExpenses is_positive AND
    existingDebt is_not_null AND
    monthlyDebtPayments is_positive AND
    verifiedAnnualRevenue is_positive
  )

# Multi-line boolean expressions with parentheses
- set meets_basic_requirements to (
    creditScore is_credit_score AND
    creditScore >= MIN_CREDIT_SCORE AND
    annualIncome is_positive AND
    customerAge >= 18
  )

# Validation operators in complex expressions
- set data_validation_passed to (
    customerName is_not_empty AND
    email is_email AND
    phone is_phone AND
    ssn is_ssn
  )
```

### Calculation Actions

The rule engine provides two commands for computed values:

**`calculate`** - For mathematical operations only:
- Arithmetic expressions (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `**`)
- Mathematical calculations with numbers
- Expressions that produce numeric results

**`run`** - For function invocations and external operations:
- Function calls (e.g., `max()`, `min()`, `abs()`, `format_currency()`)
- REST API calls (e.g., `rest_get()`, `rest_post()`)
- JSON operations (e.g., `json_get()`, `json_exists()`)
- String functions (e.g., `upper()`, `lower()`, `trim()`)
- Any operation that invokes a function or external service

```yaml
# ‚úÖ CORRECT: Use 'calculate' for mathematical operations
- calculate total as amount + tax
- calculate monthly_payment as principal * rate / (1 - (1 + rate) ** -term)
- calculate debt_ratio as monthlyDebt / annualIncome
- calculate compound_amount as principal * (1 + rate) ** years

# ‚úÖ CORRECT: Use 'run' for function calls
- run maximum as max(value1, value2, value3)
- run minimum as min(score1, score2, score3)
- run formatted_amount as format_currency(total)
- run absolute_value as abs(difference)

# ‚úÖ CORRECT: Use 'run' for REST API calls
- run api_data as rest_get("https://api.example.com/data")
- run post_result as rest_post("https://api.example.com/submit", data)

# ‚úÖ CORRECT: Use 'run' for JSON operations
- run user_name as json_get(response, "user.name")
- run has_email as json_exists(response, "email")
- calculate item_count as json_size(response, "items")

# ‚ùå INCORRECT: Don't use 'calculate' for function calls
# - calculate maximum as max(value1, value2, value3)  # Wrong!

# ‚ùå INCORRECT: Don't use 'calculate' for REST calls
# - calculate api_data as rest_get("https://api.example.com")  # Wrong!
```

### Arithmetic Actions

```yaml
# Modify existing variables
- add 10 to base_score
- subtract penalty from total_score
- multiply risk_factor by 1.5
- divide monthly_payment by 2
```

### List Operations

```yaml
# List manipulation
- append "HIGH_RISK" to risk_factors
- prepend "PRIORITY" to processing_flags
- remove "TEMPORARY" from account_flags
```

### Loop Operations

The rule engine supports three types of loops: `forEach` for iterating over lists, `while` for conditional loops, and `do-while` for loops that execute at least once.

#### forEach Loop

The `forEach` action allows you to iterate over lists and perform actions on each element.

**Basic Syntax:**
```yaml
# Simple iteration
- forEach item in items: set total to total + item

# With index variable
- forEach item, index in items: set processedItems[index] to item * 2

# Multiple actions (separated by semicolons)
- forEach num in numbers: set temp to num * 2; calculate total as total + temp
```

**Common Use Cases:**

```yaml
# Sum all values in a list
- set total to 0
- forEach amount in amounts: calculate total as total + amount

# Process each item with conditions
- set validCount to 0
- forEach score in scores: if score at_least 70 then add 1 to validCount

# Build a new list from existing data
- set doubledValues to []
- forEach value in values: append value * 2 to doubledValues

# Iterate with index for position-based logic
- set indexSum to 0
- forEach item, index in items: calculate indexSum as indexSum + index

# String concatenation
- set sentence to ""
- forEach word in words: set sentence to sentence + word + " "

# Filter and accumulate
- set evenSum to 0
- forEach num in numbers: if num % 2 equals 0 then calculate evenSum as evenSum + num
```

**Advanced Examples:**

```yaml
# Multi-step processing in forEach
- set processedData to []
- forEach record in records: set temp to record * 1.1; append temp to processedData

# Nested conditions within forEach
- set highCount to 0
- set mediumCount to 0
- set lowCount to 0
- forEach score in scores: if score at_least 80 then add 1 to highCount
- forEach score in scores: if score at_least 60 and score less_than 80 then add 1 to mediumCount
- forEach score in scores: if score less_than 60 then add 1 to lowCount

# Using index for calculations
- set weightedSum to 0
- forEach value, position in values: calculate weightedSum as weightedSum + (value * position)
```

**Important Notes:**
- The iteration variable (e.g., `item`) is available only within the forEach body
- The index variable (if specified) starts at 0
- Multiple actions must be separated by semicolons (`;`)
- forEach can be nested, but keep complexity manageable for maintainability
- The list expression can be an input variable, computed variable, or expression

#### while Loop

The `while` action executes actions repeatedly as long as a condition is true. The condition is checked **before** each iteration.

**Basic Syntax:**
```yaml
# Simple while loop
- while counter less_than 10: add 1 to counter

# Multiple actions (separated by semicolons)
- while counter less_than 10: calculate total as total + counter; add 1 to counter

# Complex condition
- while counter less_than maxValue and total less_than 100: calculate total as total + counter; add 1 to counter
```

**Common Use Cases:**

```yaml
# Count to a target value
- set counter to 0
- while counter less_than 10: add 1 to counter

# Accumulate until threshold
- set sum to 0
- set index to 0
- while sum less_than 100: calculate sum as sum + index; add 1 to index

# Process with dynamic condition
- set attempts to 0
- set success to false
- while attempts less_than 5 and success equals false: call tryOperation with []; add 1 to attempts

# Build a sequence
- set fibonacci to [0, 1]
- set count to 2
- while count less_than 10: set next to fibonacci[count - 1] + fibonacci[count - 2]; append next to fibonacci; add 1 to count
```

**Important Notes:**
- The condition is evaluated **before** each iteration
- If the condition is false initially, the loop body never executes
- Maximum iterations limit: 1000 (prevents infinite loops)
- Multiple actions must be separated by semicolons (`;`)
- The loop variable must be modified within the loop to avoid infinite loops

#### do-while Loop

The `do-while` action executes actions at least once, then repeats as long as a condition is true. The condition is checked **after** each iteration.

**Basic Syntax:**
```yaml
# Simple do-while loop
- do: add 1 to counter while counter less_than 10

# Multiple actions (separated by semicolons)
- do: calculate total as total + counter; add 1 to counter while counter less_than 10

# Complex condition
- do: set temp to value * 2; add temp to total while total less_than 100
```

**Common Use Cases:**

```yaml
# Execute at least once, then check condition
- set counter to 0
- do: add 1 to counter while counter less_than 5

# Process until condition met (guaranteed first execution)
- set result to 0
- do: calculate result as result + 10 while result less_than 50

# Retry logic with guaranteed first attempt
- set attempts to 0
- do: call processData with []; add 1 to attempts while attempts less_than 3

# Build data with initial value
- set values to []
- set current to 1
- do: append current to values; multiply current by 2 while current less_than 100
```

**Important Notes:**
- The loop body **always executes at least once**, even if the condition is initially false
- The condition is evaluated **after** each iteration
- Maximum iterations limit: 1000 (prevents infinite loops)
- Multiple actions must be separated by semicolons (`;`)
- Useful when you need guaranteed first execution before checking the condition

#### Loop Comparison

| Loop Type | Condition Check | Minimum Executions | Use When |
|-----------|----------------|-------------------|----------|
| `forEach` | N/A (iterates over list) | 0 (if list is empty) | You have a list to iterate over |
| `while` | Before each iteration | 0 (if condition is false) | You need to check condition before executing |
| `do-while` | After each iteration | 1 (always executes once) | You need guaranteed first execution |

**Example Comparison:**

```yaml
# forEach - iterates over existing list
- forEach item in [1, 2, 3]: calculate total as total + item

# while - may not execute if condition is false
- set counter to 10
- while counter less_than 5: add 1 to counter  # Never executes

# do-while - always executes at least once
- set counter to 10
- do: add 1 to counter while counter less_than 5  # Executes once, then stops
```

## Implementation Notes

### Parser Architecture
- **AST-Based**: All syntax is parsed into strongly-typed Abstract Syntax Tree nodes
- **Expression-Driven**: Actions and conditions support complex nested expressions
- **Type-Safe**: Automatic type inference and validation during parsing
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error reporting with source location information

### Recent Parser Enhancements (v2.1.0+)
- **Validation Operators in Expressions**: Validation operators like `is_positive`, `is_email`, `is_phone`, etc. can now be used in complex expressions, not just simple conditions
- **Complex Boolean Expressions**: Multi-line boolean expressions with AND/OR operators and parentheses are fully supported in both conditions and expressions
- **Enhanced ExpressionParser**: The ExpressionParser now supports validation operators as unary operations, enabling natural syntax like `(email is_email AND phone is_phone)`
- **Unified Operator Support**: Both ConditionParser and ExpressionParser now support the same set of validation operators for consistent syntax across the DSL
- **BETWEEN Operator Improvements**: Fixed parsing issues with `BETWEEN` operator to properly handle `value between min and max` syntax
- **Age Operators in Expressions**: `age_at_least` and `age_less_than` operators now work correctly in both conditions and expressions

### Performance Considerations
- **AST Caching**: Parsed rule models are cached for improved performance
- **Lazy Evaluation**: Expressions are evaluated only when needed
- **Connection Pooling**: R2DBC connection pools are optimized for high-load scenarios
- **Batch Operations**: Support for bulk rule evaluation capabilities

### Validation and Error Handling
- **Syntax Validation**: Complete DSL syntax validation during rule definition
- **Runtime Validation**: Type checking and constraint validation during execution
- **Circuit Breaker**: Built-in resilience patterns for external service calls
- **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive logging of all rule operations and decisions

## Recent Updates

### Version 2.1.0 - Enhanced Expression Support
- **Validation Operators in Expressions**: All validation operators (`is_positive`, `is_email`, `is_phone`, `is_credit_score`, etc.) can now be used in complex expressions
- **Multi-line Boolean Expressions**: Support for complex boolean expressions with AND/OR operators and parentheses in both conditions and expressions
- **Enhanced Parser Architecture**: ExpressionParser now supports validation operators as unary operations for consistent syntax
- **BETWEEN Operator Fixes**: Resolved parsing conflicts where ExpressionParser was consuming AND tokens needed by BETWEEN operator
- **Age Operator Support**: Added proper support for `age_at_least` and `age_less_than` operators in both expression and condition contexts
- **Real-world Testing**: Validated with comprehensive B2B credit scoring scenarios including multi-stage evaluation workflows

### Syntax Examples Added
- Complex boolean expressions with validation operators in `set` actions
- Multi-line expressions with proper parentheses grouping
- Validation operators in conditional expressions
- Mixed validation and comparison operators in complex conditions
